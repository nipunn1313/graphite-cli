## What is Graphite?

Graphite is an [open source CLI](https://github.com/screenplaydev/graphite-cli/) + a [code review dashboard on top of GitHub](https://app.graphite.dev) that makes **creating & reviewing stacked changes fast & intuitive.**  Anyone with write access can start using Graphite individually without needing their coworkers to change tools - we'll seamlessly sync your code changes and reviews.  We built Graphite because we missed tools like Phabricator (at Facebook) and Critique (Google) that help engineers create and ship small, incremental changes, and long-term weâ€™re passionate about creating a powerful, modern code review experience (think Linear for CR) for fast-moving eng teams.

Unfortunately, due to limitations of Github, external contributors without write access are not supported.
